a new project for a code builder in PHP for the DA App.
This is because every sw system should have a code maintenance system associated.
No code building at run-time, or only in limited cases.
Criteria must be related to: parallel and independent blocks and operations.
But automatic code building according to your own standards is cost effective and very powerfull.

It means that it is necessary to define:
	- standard nam for persistences:
		- RDBMS: basic nams >> queries >> Tables, 	ex. IdProfileFeatureAuth,IdProfile,ProfileNam,IdFeature,FeatureNam,IdAuthLevel,AuthLevelNam
		- FS: basic nams >> from CSV, ...
	- standard Nam for UI:
		- NamSep: '_'
		- NamSpaceSep: '.'
		- ParentNamSpace: 'da'

		- Entity	: <Entity>													ex. Alg
		- UIPanelNam: <Entity><PanelType> 										ex. AlgRead
		- UICtrlNam	: <UIPanelNam> + NamSep + <fieldNam> 							ex. AlgRead_IdAlg
		- UIPanelJS	: <ParentNamSpace> + <NamSpaceSep> + <UIPanelNam>			ex. da.AlgRead

	- standard code chuncks for 
		- CLIENT SIDE
			- layout: disposition of standardParts.ex. Adminlte
			- standardParts: headings, menubars, toolbars, sidebars, contents
			- navigation: structure of menus and bars
			- containers ex. main,  grids (contentType), panels (panelTypes),
			- panel contents:  ctrls (fields, tables, tree, editors, graphs, ...), 
		- SERVER SIDE	
			- Proxy: AJAX-POST request array >> JSON response
			- OpCtrl: web of OpCtrls
			- Dao: percistence access
			- Persistence: RDBMS, FS
